Synopsis and Motivation

An example developed during class at Wyncode with Ed Toro. This was an introduction to AJAX and how to implement it through Rails 5.

Installation

Clone project and launch through your text editor and terminal.

Tests

Sign up as new user and start creating data through the forms in the next pages. This is like creating a task that allows you to create additional tasks within that task. Only in this case, the first task is a cat, and the inner task is a life.

Contributors

This was a personal project in class.
